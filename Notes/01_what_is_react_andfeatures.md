React(aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building composable user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach.

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

In May 2013, at JSConf US, the project was officially open-sourced, marking a significant turning point in its adoption and growth.

The major features of React are:

Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
git 
It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.

Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).

Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding.

Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
