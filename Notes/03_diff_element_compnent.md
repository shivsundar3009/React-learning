An element in React is a plain JavaScript object that represents a piece of UI. It describes what you want to see on the screen. It's typically created using JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax or React's createElement() function. Elements are lightweight and immutable.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

Elements are not directly interactive. They represent what should appear on the screen, but they don't have behavior on their own.


A component is a reusable and modular building block in React that encapsulates a piece of UI along with its behavior. It can be a class component or a function component. Components can accept input data called props and maintain their own internal state. They can also contain other components.

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Components are more powerful than elements because they can contain logic, handle events, manage state, and accept input data. They are the building blocks of a React application.

In summary, while both elements and components are used to build UI in React, elements represent the actual UI elements that appear on the screen, while components are reusable pieces of code that encapsulate UI elements along with their behavior and state.
